## Quick Start

1. **Download all files** to a folder on your computer
2. **Get a Gemini API key** (see setup instructions below)
3. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser
4. **Click "Explain Algorithm with AI"** and enter your API key when prompted
5. **Start visualizing!** Generate arrays, select algorithms, and watch them sort

## Gemini AI Integration Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Free Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key (keep it secure!)

### Step 2: Configure the API Key in the Application

1. Open the sorting visualizer in your browser
2. Click the "ðŸ¤– Explain Algorithm with AI" button
3. When prompted, paste your API key
4. The key will be saved locally in your browser for future use

### Step 3: Test the AI Integration

1. Select any sorting algorithm from the dropdown
2. Click "ðŸ¤– Explain Algorithm with AI"
3. Wait for the AI to generate a detailed explanation
4. The explanation will appear in a modal with comprehensive algorithm details

## How to Use the Visualizer

### Basic Controls

- **Choose Algorithm**: Select from 6 different sorting algorithms
- **Array Size**: Adjust the number of elements to sort (10-100)
- **Speed**: Control animation speed (1-10, where 10 is fastest)
- **Generate New Array**: Create a new random array
- **Start Sorting**: Begin the sorting animation
- **Stop**: Halt the current sorting process
- **Reset**: Reset the visualization to initial state

### Understanding the Visualization

- **Blue Bars**: Normal array elements
- **Red Bars**: Elements being compared
- **Yellow/Pink Bars**: Elements being swapped
- **Green Bars**: Sorted elements (final state)

### Statistics Panel

- **Comparisons**: Number of element comparisons made
- **Swaps**: Number of element swaps performed
- **Time Complexity**: Big O notation for time complexity
- **Space Complexity**: Big O notation for space complexity

## Supported Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort** - O(nÂ²) time, O(1) space
2. **Selection Sort** - O(nÂ²) time, O(1) space
3. **Insertion Sort** - O(nÂ²) time, O(1) space
4. **Merge Sort** - O(n log n) time, O(n) space
5. **Quick Sort** - O(n log n) average time, O(log n) space
6. **Heap Sort** - O(n log n) time, O(1) space
